Can mine gold data from http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/goldhistory.php :
	- to get 2016/2017 use URL
		- http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/goldhistory.php?ddYears=<year {2016, 2017}>
	- to get 1968 - 2016 use URL
		- http://www.usagold.com/reference/goldprices/1968.html
		- replaces 1968 with year from 1968 - 2016

Can mine silver prices in the same way from a slightly different URL:
	- http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/silverhistory.php
	- 2015 - 2017: http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/silverhistory.php?ddYear=<year {2015, 2016, 2017}>
	- 1968 - 2016: http://www.usagold.com/reference/silverprices/1968.html
		- replace 1968 with a year from 1968 to 2016
		
Quandl also has perth mint

	-- would probably be easier to grab from here, exports a nice CSV so there is no parsing
		-- CSV changes format, for later years there are blank rows for weekend recent years just remove the dates
			-- remove the blanks
